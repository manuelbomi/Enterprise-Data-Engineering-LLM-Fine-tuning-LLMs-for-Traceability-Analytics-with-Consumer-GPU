# Enterprise Data Engineering LLM: Fine-tuning for Traceability & Analytics with Consumer GPU
### Revolutionizing Enterprise AI with Accessible Hardware

## Project Overview
##### Enterprise Data Engineering LLM is a cutting-edge project that demonstrates how to fine-tune large language models (specifically Google's Gemma 2B) for enterprise data engineering tasks using consumer-grade hardware (RTX 4070). The project focuses on creating a specialized LLM capable of handling complex data engineering workflows including:

- Structured Data Extraction - Converting natural language descriptions into structured JSON

- Schema Inference - Automatically designing database schemas from data descriptions

- Data Quality Rules - Generating validation rules for enterprise data

- ETL Pipeline Design - Creating data pipeline architectures

- SQL Optimization - Improving database query performance

#### Breaking the cost barrier of enterprise AI: 
The project also demonstrates how to fine-tune sophisticated Large Language Models for complex data engineering tasks using consumer-grade NVIDIA RTX 4070 GPU instead of expensive enterprise hardware.
